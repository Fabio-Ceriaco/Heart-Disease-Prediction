# Heart-Disease-Prediction

In this project, I will build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics.
The model will be trained on a dataset containing patient information and their heart disease status.
The goal is to accurately classify whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) based on the input features.

# DataSet Structure:

  age: Age of the patient
  sex: Sex of the patient
  cp: Chest pain type
  trestbps: Resting blood pressure
  chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
  fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
  restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
  thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
  exang: Exercise induced angina
  oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
  thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
  target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence; 0 = absence)
